# Heart-Disease-Classification-using-Machine-Learning-and-EDA
The project aims to build a machine learning model to classify and predict heart disease presence based on various health parameters. The project will involve exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, visualize important features, and preprocess the data for machine learning algorithms.
